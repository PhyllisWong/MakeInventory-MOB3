## Notes Core Data

ORM - object relational mapping, data manager

##### Technical Terms
1. NSManagedObject (MO) : temp representation of an object in the object store
1. NSManagedObjectContext (MOC) : primary interface between your app code and core data.
1. NSPersistentStoreCoordinator (PSC) : hides implementation details of persistent object from the (MOC)
1. NSPersistentStore (PS) : actual storage
1. NSManagedObjectModel (MOM) : describes the schema



##### Why we learning Core Data
* journal app can save the users entries
* user object with coordinates of the home, school, work
* store an image
* most powerful persistence framework in iOS
* used by majority of apps that have local storage
* if you master core data, you can use any iOS framework

##### Core Data Stack
* NSManagedObject
    * NSManagedObjectContext <> Persisted Store Coordinator
        * Persisted Object Store
            * Database
* We mostly interact with the managed object

##### ManagedObject
* temp representation of an object in the persisted store
* all managedObjects need to be registered with one ManagedObjectContext
* you can create Custom Managed Object Subclasses

##### ManagedObjectModel
* create a data model visually
* entities are managed objects
* set relationships, one-to-one, or one-to-many
* try to specify relationships in both directions
* ...

##### Adding Core Data to a Project
* When you initialize Core Data, Apple will dump a bunch of boilerplate code into your project.
* You can delete the boiler plate code, and then create it yourself.
* Create custom NSManagedObjects, generates a blank class, that allows you to customize
